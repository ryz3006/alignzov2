  - Automatic cleanup on component unmount
  - Only updates when timers are visible and expanded
- **Benefits**: Users see accurate, real-time progress

### 8. Resume Functionality
- **Feature**: Paused timers can be resumed
- **Implementation**:
  - New backend endpoint: `PATCH /api/time-sessions/:id/resume`
  - Frontend resume button in active timers display
  - Proper state management and validation
- **Benefits**: Flexible time tracking workflow
