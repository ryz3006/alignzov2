# üîê Permission Standardization Implementation Summary

## Overview

This summarizes the standardization now in place: unified `resource.action` permissions, backend `PermissionGuard` with `@RequirePermissions`, and removal of CRUD UI around the `permissions` resource.

## ‚úÖ Completed Implementation

### Backend Controller Updates
- All controllers use `@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, PermissionGuard)` and `@RequirePermissions('<resource>', '<action>')`.
- `roles/:id/permissions` assignment requires `roles.assign_permission`.
- Reading role permissions requires `roles.read`.

### Permissions Controller
- Permissions list endpoints are available to power role editing, but the service excludes `resource === 'permissions'` from lists to avoid UI exposure.
- No UI for CRUD of the `permissions` resource.

### Seed and Roles
- `SUPER_ADMIN`: assigned all permissions including role assign/unassign.
- `ADMIN`: baseline read permissions across core resources.
- Removed `permissions.*` CRUD from seed; added `roles.assign_permission` and `roles.unassign_permission`.

## Before ‚Üí After (Highlights)

- Removed API/UI-suffixed permission names (e.g., `users.api.create`, `users.ui.create`) ‚Üí use `users.create`, `users.read`, etc.
- Removed `permissions.*` from UI and role form filters.
- Added role-level actions:
  - `roles.assign_permission`
  - `roles.unassign_permission`

## Best Practices
- Backend is the source of truth for authorization.
- Use standardized `resource.action` names consistently.
- Keep the `permissions` resource hidden from UI; manage permissions via roles only.

## Next Steps (if needed)
- Review org-specific default roles and baseline permissions.
- Add missing module permissions as new features roll out.
