## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Structure

```typescript
// Main Components
- TeamsPage (Wrapper with permission guard)
- TeamsPageContent (Main component with all functionality)
- TeamForm (Modal for create/edit operations)
- Team View Modal (Detailed team information)

// Key Interfaces
interface TeamData {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  leader: { id, firstName, lastName, displayName, email };
  organization: { id, name };
  members: Array<{ id, user, role, joinedAt }>;
  projects: Array<{ id, project }>;
  _count: { members: number; projects: number };
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}
```

### Backend Structure

```typescript
// Service Methods
- create(createTeamDto): Create new team with members
- findAll(userId): Get teams based on user permissions
- findOne(id, userId): Get single team with access control
- update(id, updateTeamDto, userId): Update team information
- remove(id, userId): Delete team with business logic validation
- addMember(teamId, userId, requestingUserId): Add member to team
- removeMember(teamId, userId, requestingUserId): Remove member from team
```

## Permission System

### Permission Guards

```typescript
// Page Level
- TeamsPageGuard: Controls access to the teams page

// Component Level
- TeamsPermissionGuard: General teams access
- TeamsCreatePermissionGuard: Create teams permission
- TeamsUpdatePermissionGuard: Update teams permission
- TeamsDeletePermissionGuard: Delete teams permission
- TeamsExportPermissionGuard: Export teams permission
- TeamsBulkActionsPermissionGuard: Bulk operations permission
```

### Permission Logic

```typescript
// Admin Access
- SUPER_ADMIN: Full access to all teams
- ADMIN: Full access to all teams in organization

// User Access
- Regular users: Can only see teams they're members of
- Team leaders: Can manage their own teams
- Team members: Can view team details
```

## CRUD Operations

### Create Operation

```typescript
// Frontend Flow
1. User clicks "Create Team" button
2. TeamForm modal opens with empty form
3. User fills in team details and selects leader/members
4. Form validates and submits to backend
5. Backend creates team and team members in transaction
6. Success notification and modal closes
7. Teams list refreshes

// Backend Validation
- Team name uniqueness within organization
- Leader existence and active status
- Member existence and active status
- Organization ID requirement
```

### Read Operation

```typescript
// Data Fetching
- React Query for caching and state management
- Automatic refetch on mutations
- Error handling with retry mechanisms
- Loading states with skeleton UI

// Access Control
- Admin users see all teams
- Regular users see only their team memberships
- Team details include full member and project information
```

### Update Operation

```typescript
// Update Capabilities
- Team name and description
- Team leader reassignment
- Member addition/removal
- Organization changes

// Validation Rules
- Name uniqueness check
- Permission validation (admin or team leader)
- Member existence validation
- Soft delete for removed members
```

### Delete Operation

```typescript
// Business Logic Constraints
- Teams with active projects cannot be deleted
- Teams with additional members (beyond leader) cannot be deleted
- Teams with only the leader can be deleted
- Soft delete implementation (isActive: false)

// Frontend Validation
- Pre-deletion constraint checking
- User-friendly confirmation dialogs
- Visual indicators for deletable teams
- Bulk delete with partial success handling
```

## UI/UX Features

### Smart Action Buttons

```typescript
// Implementation
<SmartActionButton
  resource="teams"
  onEdit={() => handleEditTeam(team)}
  onView={() => handleViewTeam(team)}
  variant="ghost"
  size="sm"
/>

// Features
- Automatic permission-based button visibility
- Consistent styling across the application
- Tooltip information for actions
- Disabled state for unauthorized actions
```

### Filtering System

```typescript
// Search Functionality
- Real-time search across multiple fields
- Case-insensitive matching
- Debounced input handling

// Leader Filter
- Unique leader extraction from teams
- Dropdown with leader names
- "All Leaders" option for reset

// Implementation
const filteredTeams = teams.filter((team: TeamData) => {
  const matchesSearch = (team.name?.toLowerCase() || '').includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()) ||
                       (team.description?.toLowerCase() || '').includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()) ||
                       (team.leader?.displayName?.toLowerCase() || '').includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase());
  
  const matchesLeader = leaderFilter === 'all' || team.leader?.id === leaderFilter;
  
  return matchesSearch && matchesLeader;
});
```

### Statistics Cards

```typescript
// Metrics Calculated
- Total Teams: teams.length
- Total Members: teams.reduce((total, team) => total + (team._count?.members || 0), 0)
- Active Projects: teams.reduce((total, team) => total + (team._count?.projects || 0), 0)
- Average Team Size: Math.round(totalMembers / teams.length)

// Visual Design
- Grid layout with responsive breakpoints
- Icon-based visual indicators
- Color-coded metrics
- Real-time updates on data changes
```

## Error Handling

### Frontend Error Handling

```typescript
// API Error Handling
const deleteTeamMutation = useMutation({
  mutationFn: async (teamId: string) => {
    const response = await apiCall(`/api/teams/${teamId}`, { method: 'DELETE' });
    if (!response.ok) {
      const errorData = await response.json().catch(() => ({}));
      throw new Error(errorData.message || 'Failed to delete team');
    }
    return response;
  },
  onError: (error: any) => {
    const errorMessage = error.message || 'Failed to delete team';
    
    // Handle specific business logic errors
    if (errorMessage.includes('active members')) {
      toast.error('Cannot delete team with active members. Please remove all team members first (leader can remain).');
    } else if (errorMessage.includes('active projects')) {
      toast.error('Cannot delete team with active projects. Please reassign or remove projects first.');
    } else {
      toast.error(errorMessage);
    }
  },
});
```

### Backend Error Handling

```typescript
// Business Logic Errors
- ConflictException: Team name already exists
- ConflictException: Cannot delete team with active members/projects
- NotFoundException: Team or user not found
- BadRequestException: Missing required fields
- Access denied exceptions for unauthorized operations
```

## Business Logic

### Team Deletion Constraints

```typescript
// Backend Implementation
async remove(id: string, userId: string) {
  // Check if team has projects
  if (existingTeam._count.projects > 0) {
    throw new ConflictException('Cannot delete team with active projects');
  }

  // Check if team has members other than the leader
  const teamMembers = await this.prisma.teamMember.findMany({
    where: {
      teamId: id,
      isActive: true,
      userId: { not: existingTeam.leaderId }, // Exclude the leader
    },
  });

  if (teamMembers.length > 0) {
    throw new ConflictException('Cannot delete team with active members. Please remove all team members first.');
  }

  // Soft delete the team
  return this.prisma.team.update({
    where: { id },
    data: { isActive: false },
  });
}

// Frontend Implementation
const hasOtherMembers = team?._count?.members > 1; // More than just the leader
const hasProjects = team?._count?.projects > 0;

// Delete button state
disabled={team._count?.members > 1 || team._count?.projects > 0}
```

### Member Management

```typescript
// Leader Assignment
- Leader is automatically added as a team member
- Leader role is set to 'lead' in team membership
- Leader cannot be removed from team (business constraint)

// Member Roles
- 'lead': Team leader with full management permissions
- 'member': Regular team member with view permissions

// Member Constraints
- Users can only be members of teams they have access to
- Team leaders can add/remove members from their teams
- Admins can manage all team memberships
```

## Known Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: Duplicate React Keys

**Problem**: Duplicate keys in leader filter dropdown causing React warnings.

**Root Cause**: Multiple teams with the same leader created duplicate keys.

**Solution**:
```typescript
// Before (causing duplicate keys)
{teams.map((team: TeamData) => (
  <option key={team.leader?.id} value={team.leader?.id}>
    {team.leader?.displayName || 'Unknown Leader'}
  </option>
))}

// After (unique keys)
const uniqueLeaders = teams.reduce((leaders: Array<{id: string, displayName: string}>, team: TeamData) => {
  if (team.leader?.id && !leaders.find(l => l.id === team.leader?.id)) {
    leaders.push({
      id: team.leader.id,
      displayName: team.leader.displayName || 'Unknown Leader'
    });
  }
  return leaders;
}, []);

{uniqueLeaders.map((leader: {id: string, displayName: string}) => (
  <option key={leader.id} value={leader.id}>
    {leader.displayName}
  </option>
))}
```

### Issue 2: Team Deletion with Only Leader

**Problem**: Teams with only the leader could not be deleted due to member count validation.

**Root Cause**: Backend was counting leader as a member and preventing deletion.

**Solution**:
```typescript
// Backend Fix
// Check if team has members other than the leader
const teamMembers = await this.prisma.teamMember.findMany({
  where: {
    teamId: id,
    isActive: true,
    userId: { not: existingTeam.leaderId }, // Exclude the leader
  },
});

if (teamMembers.length > 0) {
  throw new ConflictException('Cannot delete team with active members. Please remove all team members first.');
}

// Frontend Fix
const hasOtherMembers = team?._count?.members > 1; // More than just the leader
```

### Issue 3: 409 Conflict Error Handling

**Problem**: Generic error messages for business logic constraints.

**Solution**:
```typescript
// Enhanced error handling with specific messages
onError: (error: any) => {
  const errorMessage = error.message || 'Failed to delete team';
  
  if (errorMessage.includes('active members')) {
    toast.error('Cannot delete team with active members. Please remove all team members first (leader can remain).');
  } else if (errorMessage.includes('active projects')) {
    toast.error('Cannot delete team with active projects. Please reassign or remove projects first.');
  } else {
    toast.error(errorMessage);
  }
}
```
